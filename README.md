These are the different scripts I've used throughout my Masters project. 
They are grouped in the branches by general purpose. 

Scripts that were provided to me were:
run_multi_hudson.py
run_multi_plevin.py
glycan_tree_type_identifier.py
privateer_wurcs.py
process_wurcs.py
test_glycan_tree_type_identifier.py

All other scripts were written by me with occassional assistance from Jordan Dialpuri. 
Some scripts were built on the code of previous ones which were provided to me.
